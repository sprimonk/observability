## Stackdriver Limitation

### Application Monitoring

#### **List of app metrics available in Stackdriver**
* Request count: Number of requests processed by your application
* Error rate: Percentage of requests that resulted in errors
* Latency: Time taken for requests to complete
* CPU utilization: Percentage of CPU utilization by your application
* Memory usage: Amount of memory used by your application
* Disk I/O: Disk I/O operations performed by your application
* Network I/O: Network I/O operations performed by your application
* HTTP response codes: Count of each HTTP response code generated by your application
* Trace data: Information about individual requests processed by your application

#### **List of app metrics NOT available in Stackdriver**
* Trace data: Information about individual requests processed by your application
* Code-level performance metrics: Detailed performance metrics for individual code components within your application
* Transaction tracing: Information about how individual requests flow through your application, including response time and latency data
* Performance profiling: Information about how different components of your code are impacting performance

#### **Summary** : Stackdriver provides monitoring for basic application metrics such as request count, error rate, and response time however datadog and appd can also provide code-level visibility, transaction tracing, and performance profiling so it can be a competitor in infra monitoring but not application monitoring.

### Log Management

* Log Collection and Parsing: Datadog provides more advanced log collection and parsing capabilities, making it easier to extract meaningful information from log data. For example, Datadog provides automatic log parsing that can extract key-value pairs from log data, making it easier to search and analyze log data.

* Log Management and Retention: Datadog provides more flexible and configurable log management and retention capabilities than Stackdriver. This allows you to set custom retention policies for log data and manage log data more effectively.

* Log Analytics: Datadog provides more advanced log analytics capabilities, allowing you to perform complex queries and correlations across log data. This can help you quickly identify issues and troubleshoot problems more effectively.

* Log Visualization: Datadog provides more sophisticated log visualization capabilities, making it easier to understand the relationships between log events and identify patterns in log data. This can help you more quickly identify issues and troubleshoot problems.

## Glossary

* **Code-level visibility** refers to the ability to monitor the performance of individual code components within an application. This includes the ability to see how individual requests are flowing through the application and how long each component of the code is taking to complete. This level of visibility provides insights into the performance of individual code components and can help to identify performance bottlenecks.

* **Severice Level Agreement (SLA)** The SLA is the entire agreement that specifies what service is to be provided, how it is supported, times, locations, costs, performance, and responsibilities of the parties involved.

* **Severice Level Objective (SLO)** SLOs are specific measurable characteristics of the SLA such as availability, throughput, frequency, response time, or quality. These SLOs together are meant to define the expected service between the provider and the customer and vary depending on the service's urgency, resources, and budget. SLOs provide a quantitative means to define the level of service a customer can expect from a provider.  Without an SLO, your team has no principled way of saying what level of downtime is acceptable; there's no way to measure whether or not this a significant issue with the service and you cannot terminate the escalation early.

* Example

Type of measure       | Example SLO Requirement  | Measurement Period   | 
------------- | -------------| ------------- | 
Availability | The application will be available 99.95% of the time  | Over a year  | 
Service Desk Response | 75% of help desk calls will be answered in less than a minute  | Over a month  | 
Service Desk Response | 85% of help desk calls will be answered within two minutes  | Over a month  | 
Service Desk Response | 100% of help desk calls will be answered within three minutes  | Over a month  | 
Response Time | 85% of TCP replies within 1.5 seconds of receiving a request  | Over a month  | 

SLA : a guranteee provided by the service provider that my service is going to be 99.9 % available to the end user. If I fail to achieve this objective we will pay you back 10% of the subscription fee.
